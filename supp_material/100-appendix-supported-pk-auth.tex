    \caption*{SSH public key algorithms and their support by SSH clients, \texttt{@openssh.com} abbreviated to \texttt{@}, sourced from official vendor documentation (\url{https://www.openssh.com/specs.html}) and the client's configuration. Support for an algorithm is denoted by a filled circle (\supported), while an outlined circle (\unsupported) indicates the lack thereof. Partial support (\partialsupport) indicates that support may be enabled explicitly at build time but is disabled by default. Data points in light gray indicate the need for experimental verification due to the lack of vendor documentation and configurable public key algorithms. }
